# Documentation and tools to analyze MS Word documents
2023-04-15: A .docx or .docm MS Word file is a compressed Zip archive, containing several XML files. They can also contain embedded OLE objects and VBA macros, which are binary files. I wrote a document describing the structure of such files and a Python program demonstrating how to decode these binary files, based on the Microsoft Compound File Binary format specification.
